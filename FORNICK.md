# FORNICK.md - Fitness 1RM Tracker

## What This Is

A single-page webapp for tracking your lifts and calculating your one-rep max (1RM). Think of it as a digital training log that follows you to any gym, on any device.

## The Problem It Solves

You're at the gym, you just hit 225 for 5 reps on bench. You want to know:
1. What's my estimated 1RM from this set?
2. How does this compare to my best ever?
3. Is this progress or am I plateauing?

Scribbling in a notebook works, but it stays at home. Spreadsheets are clunky on your phone mid-set. This app gives you instant answers with one hand while you're still catching your breath.

## Technical Architecture

### The Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no frameworks, no build step)
- **Backend**: Firebase (Google's serverless platform)
  - **Authentication**: Google Sign-in
  - **Database**: Cloud Firestore (NoSQL)
- **Hosting**: Static files - can be hosted anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, your own server)

### Why Firebase?
Cross-device sync without writing a backend. Sign in on your phone at the gym, log a set. Get home, open your laptop, and it's all there. Firebase handles:
- User accounts (via Google)
- Real-time database sync
- Offline support (Firestore caches locally)

### Data Model
```
users/{userId}/
  ├── exercises: ["Squat", "Bench Press", "Deadlift", ...]  // User's exercise list
  └── logs/{logId}: {
        exercise: "Bench Press",
        weight: 225,
        reps: 5,
        calculatedOneRM: 262.5,
        date: Timestamp
      }
```

Each user gets their own document with:
- An array of their custom exercises
- A subcollection of workout logs

## The Math: Rep-Optimized Formulas

Different rep ranges respond better to different formulas, so we use four:

| Reps | Formula | Why |
|------|---------|-----|
| 1-5 | **Epley**: `weight × (1 + reps/30)` | Gold standard for strength work |
| 6-10 | **Brzycki**: `weight × (36 / (37 - reps))` | More accurate in hypertrophy range |
| 11-15 | **Lombardi**: `weight × (reps ^ 0.10)` | Better for moderate endurance |
| 16-20 | **Mayhew**: `100 × weight / (52.2 + 41.9 × e^(-0.055 × reps))` | Handles high-rep sets |
| 20+ | Capped at 20 | Beyond 20 reps, you're testing endurance not strength |

**Example calculations:**
- 225 lbs × 5 reps (Epley) = **262.5 lbs**
- 185 lbs × 8 reps (Brzycki) = **229.7 lbs**
- 135 lbs × 12 reps (Lombardi) = **173.5 lbs**
- 95 lbs × 18 reps (Mayhew) = **139.2 lbs**

**Why multiple formulas?** Each was derived from studies on different training populations and rep ranges. Epley works great for powerlifters doing triples, but overestimates for someone doing sets of 15. By switching formulas based on reps, you get more accurate estimates across all training styles.

## File Structure

```
fitness/
├── index.html      # Single page structure + Firebase SDK imports
├── style.css       # Dark theme, mobile-first responsive
├── app.js          # All logic: auth, Firestore, calculations
└── FORNICK.md      # You are here
```

### index.html
- Login screen (shown when signed out)
- Main app container (shown when signed in)
- Sections: Calculator, Log Workout, Manage Exercises, History
- Imports Firebase SDK from CDN (compat version for simpler syntax)

### style.css
- CSS custom properties (variables) for theming
- Dark theme: deep navy background, red accent (#e94560)
- Mobile-first: large touch targets (48px minimum), big text
- No CSS framework - just clean, minimal styles

### app.js
The brain of the operation:
- Firebase initialization and auth state management
- CRUD operations for exercises and workout logs
- 1RM calculation using Epley formula
- History rendering with PR detection
- Caches best 1RMs per exercise for instant % calculations

## Key Code Patterns

### Auth State Machine
```javascript
auth.onAuthStateChanged((user) => {
  if (user) {
    // Show app, load data
  } else {
    // Show login, clear state
  }
});
```
Firebase calls this whenever auth state changes. One listener handles everything.

### Firestore Writes with Optimistic UI
```javascript
// Add to Firestore
const logRef = await db.collection('users')...add(data);

// Immediately update local state
workoutLogs.unshift(newLog);
renderHistory();
```
We don't wait for Firestore to confirm - the UI updates instantly, assuming success. If Firebase is offline, it queues the write and syncs later.

### PR Detection
After loading all logs, we build a lookup table of best 1RMs:
```javascript
bestOneRMs = {}; // { "Bench Press": 275, "Squat": 315, ... }
```
Each history entry checks if it matches the best - if so, it gets a 🏆.

## Setup Instructions

1. Go to [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Create a new project (disable Google Analytics if you want, not needed)
3. Click "Authentication" → "Get Started" → Enable "Google" provider
4. Click "Firestore Database" → "Create database" → Start in test mode
5. Go to Project Settings → Your apps → Add web app
6. Copy the config object into `app.js` (replace the placeholder)

### Firestore Security Rules (Production)
For real use, update your Firestore rules to:
```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```
This ensures users can only access their own data.

## Design Decisions

### Why No Framework?
- Simplicity: 3 files, no build step, no node_modules
- Speed: Loads instantly, no JavaScript bundle to parse
- Maintainability: Any web developer can read vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
- For a single-page app this size, React/Vue would be overkill

### Why Dark Theme?
- Gym lighting is often harsh - dark UI is easier on the eyes
- Looks more "modern" for a fitness app
- Red accent pops against dark background

### Why Client-Side Only?
No server means:
- Zero hosting cost (static files are free everywhere)
- No backend to maintain
- Scales to any number of users (Firebase handles it)

## Lessons Learned

### Firestore Timestamps
Firestore stores timestamps as special `Timestamp` objects, not JavaScript `Date`s. Always check:
```javascript
if (date.toDate) {
  date = date.toDate();
}
```

### Mobile Input UX
- Removed number spinners (those tiny arrows are useless on mobile)
- Added `inputmode="numeric"` for better mobile keyboards
- Large tap targets (minimum 48px) for sweaty gym fingers

### The 100-Log Limit
We limit history to 100 most recent entries. Could paginate, but for a personal training log, 100 recent sets is plenty. Going back further means analyzing trends, which is a different feature.

## Future Ideas (Not Implemented)

- **Charts**: Show 1RM progress over time per exercise
- **Workout Templates**: "Leg Day" preset that queues exercises
- **Rest Timer**: Countdown between sets
- **Export**: Download data as CSV
- **PWA**: Add to home screen, work offline

## The One Thing That Would Break This

Firebase config exposed in client-side code. This is fine because:
1. Firestore security rules protect data (users can only access their own)
2. The API key is restricted to your domain
3. Firebase is designed for client-side use

But if you skip the security rules setup, anyone could read/write any user's data. **Always set up proper Firestore rules before sharing the app.**
